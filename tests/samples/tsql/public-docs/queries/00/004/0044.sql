-- A SELECT query with COUNT_BIG (DISTINCT expression) took multiple seconds to complete and it reads data directly from the base table a.

-- Check the estimated execution plan in SQL Server Management Studio.  It shows the SELECT query is first step (GET operator) is to read data from the materialized view V1, not from base table a.
select a, count_big(distinct b) from t group by a;

-- Now execute this SELECT query.  This time it took sub-second to complete because Synapse SQL engine automatically matches the query with materialized view V1 and uses it for faster query execution.  There was no change in the user query.
