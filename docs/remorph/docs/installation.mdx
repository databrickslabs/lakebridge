## Remorph
Remorph stands as a comprehensive toolkit meticulously crafted to facilitate seamless migrations to Databricks.
This suite of tools is dedicated to simplifying and optimizing the entire migration process, offering two distinctive functionalities â€“ Transpile and Reconcile. Whether you are navigating code translation or resolving potential conflicts, Remorph ensures a smooth journey for any migration project. With Remorph as your trusted ally,
the migration experience becomes not only efficient but also well-managed, setting the stage for a successful transition to the Databricks platform.

## Transpile
Transpile is a self-contained SQL parser, transpiler, and validator designed to interpret a diverse range of SQL inputs and generate syntactically and semantically correct SQL in the Databricks SQL dialect. This tool serves as an automated solution, named Transpile, specifically crafted for migrating and translating SQL scripts from various sources to the Databricks SQL format. Currently, it exclusively supports Snowflake as a source platform, leveraging the open-source SQLglot.

Transpile stands out as a comprehensive and versatile SQL transpiler, boasting a robust test suite to ensure reliability. Developed entirely in Python, it not only demonstrates high performance but also highlights syntax errors and provides warnings or raises alerts for dialect incompatibilities based on configurations.

### Transpiler Design Flow:

    D --> E
    E --> |Parse Error| F(Failed Queries)
    E --> G{Skip Validations}

    G --> |No| I{Validate}
    I --> |Success| H
    I --> |Fail| J(Flag, Capture)
    J --> H
```

## Reconcile
Reconcile is an automated tool designed to streamline the reconciliation process between source data and target data residing on Databricks. Currently, the platform exclusively offers support for Snowflake, Oracle and other  Databricks tables as the primary data source. This tool empowers users to efficiently identify discrepancies and variations in data when comparing the source with the Databricks target.

## Environment Setup
### Pre-requisites

1. `Databricks CLI` - Ensure that you have the Databricks Command-Line Interface (CLI) installed on your machine. Refer to the installation instructions provided for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, available [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/install.html#install-or-update-the-databricks-cli).

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="shell" label="Install Databricks CLI on Linux without brew" default>
        ```shell
        #!/usr/bin/env bash

        #install dependencies
        apt update && apt install -y curl sudo unzip

        #install databricks cli
        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/v0.242.0/install.sh | sudo sh
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. `Databricks CLI` - Configure the Databricks CLI by executing the following command with appropriate host and cluster details:
`profile_name` is optional, if not provided, the `DEFAULT` profile will be used.

```shell
databricks configure --host <host> --configure-cluster --profile <profile_name>
```
The Flag `--configure-cluster` gives you the prompt to select the cluster_id from the available clusters on your workspace.
Alternatively you can use the environment variable `DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_ID` to set the cluster id you would want to use
for your profile before running the `databricks configure` command.

```shell
export DATABRICKS_CLUSTER_ID=<cluster_id>
databricks configure --host <host> --profile <profile_name>
```

3. `Python` - Verify that your machine has Python version **3.10** or later installed to meet the required dependencies for seamless operation.
- `Windows` - Install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Your Windows computer will need a shell environment ([GitBash](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) or [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about))
- `MacOS/Unix` - Use [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python@3.10) to install python in macOS/Unix machines
